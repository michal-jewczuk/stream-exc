# Purpose
This is a java project with a couple of stream examples to solve.

## Where to start?
Start by implementing method *getAllProducts* from class *ProductCreator* according to the description given in docs.

## What are the rules for assignments?
1) There is no particular order in which the assignments have to be done. Each one is independent.
1) Try to solve each assignment using streams, but common sense is required.
1) Instruction for each assignment is written above the class name in each file separately.
1) Each assignment should print out first separator line, then the result.
1) Unit tests are not required, but as usual may by helpful.

## Can I change the input data?
The input data is in file *./data/examples1.txt*. This file can be modified. 
You can also create you own file/files. Just remember to update *Executor* accordingly.
